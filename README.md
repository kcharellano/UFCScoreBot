## Motivation
The motivation for this project was to learn about web scraping by implementing a bot that searches for custom info on [www.ufcstats.com](http://ufcstats.com/statistics/events/completed)

## General Info
While running, the bot periodically listens for requests on reddit via [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Look [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/api) for information on getting a Reddit API key and [here](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/configuration/prawini.html) for help on connecting your account with praw. To successfully run the bot you'll need your own `praw.ini` file in the root directory. To exit the bot you will need to manually exit the program.
